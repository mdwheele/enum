# PHP Enum

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdwheele/enum.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdwheele/enum)

Enum is an implementation of the enumeration data-type found in many languages.  This particular implementation is modeled after Python's recent implementation of enumerations.

## Installation

Install through Composer.

```js
"require": {
    "mdwheele/enum": "dev-master"
}
```

## Next Steps

* Add a static facade to create new Enum types similar to Python's functional API.
